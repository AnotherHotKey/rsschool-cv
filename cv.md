### About Me
---
I have been working for over ten years in a major news media company as a journalist, translater, copywriter and news editor. I explored how news is made and now would like to focus on formats and ways in which it is presented to consumers. I have witnessed how digital innovations have reshaped journalism and I would love to be a part of tech world.
